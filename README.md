# Drug Side Effects Classification Model

## Project Overview

This project focuses on building a machine learning classification model to categorize the side effects of a drug. The model was developed using extensive data preprocessing, feature engineering, model training, hyperparameter tuning, and evaluation techniques. The final model provides accurate predictions and is designed for potential real-world applications.
